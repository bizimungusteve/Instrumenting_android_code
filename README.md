# Instrumenting_android_code

The objective of this project is to collect runtime metrics during the execution of a set of Android apps.
To collect metrics we will apply source code instrumentation (using Spoon [2]). 
The instrumentation will collect information in relevant points of the code of the apps, for example when users interact with apps (click a button, type text, etc).
